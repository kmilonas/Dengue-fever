# Dengue-fever
Predicting dengue fever cases using environmental data. This work is done as part of a competition organized by Driven Data.

Note: this is work in progress and the predictive accuracy has room for improvement. Further to using additional ML/AI techniques, building and applying domain knowledge would likely be useful given the relatively small sample size.
